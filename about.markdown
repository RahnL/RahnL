My name is Rahn, and this has been my little place on the web since around 2008.
If you're looking for some of the old content (pre-2020), it's been archived. It may be revived over time, but the focus is on new content now.

As a youth, I spent a bit of time playing table top role playing games (RPG), such as Dungeons and Dragons.  Recently, I've been working on getting my kids involved with this type of gaming.  

++Why Role Play?
it's fun.
learn life skills
learn how to deal with people in different expectations
