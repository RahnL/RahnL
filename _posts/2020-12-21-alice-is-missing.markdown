As I'd been asking around parents of the kids friends whether their childen would be interested in playing some D&D, all the parents eagerly said something to the effect of "I dunno about the kid, but count me in!"  With that, I found myself looking for games and figuring out how to setup an online gaming session.  

A couple months ago, I was looking at <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/">Drive Thru RPG</a>, and saw the game <a href="https://www.huntersentertainment.com/alice-is-missing">Alice Is Missing</a>.  I was instantly intrigued, as it is a mystery game, meant to be played completely via text message.  It's roll playing, but without speaking!  Now, with a group of adults all eager to play a game, I bought the Roll20 version of it, and we were ready to go.

First off, the game writer, <a href="https://twitter.com/SpenserStarke">Spencer Stark</a>, is great.  As I was going through the rules and setup, I through some questions his way and he answered almost immediately. He has a set of three videos on how to put it altogether, which cover just about everything, except that the names of one of the card decks changed.
