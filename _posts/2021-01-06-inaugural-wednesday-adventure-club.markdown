Today marked the inaugural meeting of the Wednesday Adventure Club, a group of elementary and middle school students gathering to play Dungeons & Dragons for the first time.
The group consists of:
- Iik, a human fighter
- Ulfgar, a dwarf wizard
- Zeeman The Barbarian, a human
- Aros, an Elf rogue
- Rabbi Jimmy, a cleric

# The Adventure
The party started out eating together in the village in, gathering at the same table as strangers. After introductions, the innkeeper asked if they were here to seek out the evil wizard in the woods. They decided that sounded like a good quest, at which point Rabbi Jimmy at the next table offered to help lead them to the wizards lair and help them in a non-combat role.  

The next morning, the party set out, and found the hidden path off the road.  After following for a while, they came across a wolf eating a freshly killed deer. After a quick melee, the wolf ran off, howling to it's pack in the distance.  Hearing howls back, the party continued on their way.  Will we see the pack of wolves in the future? 

A short while later, the party arrived at the wizards lair. After careful inspection of the entrance to make sure there were no traps, the doors were slowly opened to reveal an entrance cave. In the cave, four skeletons slowly turned their heads toward the party....

# DM Notes
Play of the week:  While fighting the wolf, Ulfgars first ever combat, first time playing D&D, first shot of a fire bolt spell. He rolls a natural 20, a Critical Hit!  What type of damage does he want it to do? (me imagining an explosion of wolf fur coating the party in guts) "Uh, well, I don't want to kill the wolf. He's just trying to eat lunch or something. How about if I just nick his shoulder and maybe singe some fur."  Well, we did that, the wolf ran off, and called off to his friends. Lets see what happens in the future.

A decent section of the begining of the sessions was spent getting used to Roll20.  There's a bit of learning curve to get going, and more of one learning how to draw dungeons with my mousepad.

Jimmy is played by one of the parents who is provided support for the group as they get comfortable with the game.
